    "name": "Soul Pony - 4",
    "description": "This is the most advanced form of a soul pony. Their bodies become less ghostly, but their ghostly features remain and are very visible. As much as their abilities remain the same, these ponies have a harder time staying invisible. Their other special feature is that they manage to survive during the day as long as they are not exposed to the sun or strong light. The soul ponies devour many souls to improve their physical body. This is the image that represents its most advanced form. And will also be a future new character.",
