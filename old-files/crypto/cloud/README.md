# Solidity Files

All fic smart contract source codes are stored in this folder. Feel free to modify them if you are forking this repository to create your own content. All scripts are open source!

By default I use the Polygon Blockchain due to the extremely low fees of the blockchain, which allows me to create a storage environment that doesn't pay a lot of Matics Fees from your crypto wallet when executing Smart Contracts. 

Right now as I'm typing this, usually the gas fee is $0,00. Maybe the gas price may be different depending on which year you are viewing this repository.

After you deploy the contract, connect this through the file "/doc/crypto/config.js".
