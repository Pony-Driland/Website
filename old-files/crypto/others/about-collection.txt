Amy is one of Rainbow Queen's pets. Her sweet personality was a result of past events of her accidentally going to Pony Driland.
Her accident happened right during her childhood when she ran away from home, which made it impossible for her to grow like the other ponies, and she ended up spending the rest of her childhood struggling to survive on her own until she became an adult.

Amy has always tried to rediscover the things she lost as a child, which ended up making her more difficult to survive due to her depression. Amy then had a hard time socializing, getting a good job, which ended up making her feel more depressed.

Due to her depression, she lost everything, and fled to the forest, looking to be alone, but she accidentally got lost in the forest and cannot return home. She was very hungry, and sad due to the fear of her possible end of life.

When she was extremely sad and afraid to die, then she gave up on living, but during the last few seconds before she accepted her own death. Rainbow Queen appeared and interrupted her suicide attempt.

Rainbow Queen already knew she was feeling extremely sad, and tried to make Amy feel better together in the forest. Amy started feeling scared of Rainbow Queen due to Rainbow Queen's natural nature to be malignant, but as she spent more time together with Rainbow Queen getting to know her true Rainbow Queen personality. After a while Amy felt calmer, and everything that seemed to be a monster, she found that being friends with a possible monster could make her feel more secure.

Rainbow Queen despite having a dominant personality that is interested in being closer to her, Amy was very sad to have a second option, and agreed to be together with Rainbow Queen.

When Rainbow Queen realized that Amy was not wanting to be alone, Rainbow Queen being a goddess she offered a pact with Amy. Rainbow Queen invited her to be her pet, in return, she could have a much better life together with Rainbow Queen. She would have freedom of choice, but always respecting Rainbow Queen's wishes and should call her master.

Amy didn't think twice due to her sadness, and accepted her new fate. She was very scared of her choice.

Rainbow Queen then put the magic collar around her neck and made her new pet. Rainbow Queen then hugged her to calm her down and make her feel better. Amy then cried a lot again, but she slowly calmed down as she felt that even though Rainbow Queen was dominant, Rainbow Queen wanted to take care of her and not let her take her own life.

Since then many years have passed and Amy no longer knows her true age, as she always kept her youthful appearance, but many recognized her when they found her as a pony who likes to buy clothes and accessories of various types for her silly fantasy. that she loves.

Amy was no longer a depressed pony, feeling loved like the pet she is, she developed her new personality very sweet and cute. She came to be protected by Rainbow Queen through her magical collar. This made Amy develop a huge dependence on Rainbow Queen for her to feel safe while she maintained her shy personality.

She knew that through the magical collar, she could be teleported, or ask for Rainbow Queen's help. And then her new lifestyle that made her feel better continued, making her forget about her sad past, but still sometimes she was a little worried about what happened to her family, as now she was extremely far away from home.

## Character Information

### Specie

Female / Sphinx / Alicorn / Kirin

### Natural Habitat

Her home has an architecture inspired by the Egyptian culture. She has a pyramid as her home and lives on an extremely high cold mountain. Due to the extreme cold of the mountain, her natural habitat is covered by snow instead of sand. This allowed her to create a great passion for the cold climates.

She uses her divine elemental manipulation abilities to raise or lower her body temperature to her advantage in order to withstand any hot or cold temperatures, but this can use a lot of energy from her body.

### Hobby

Her favorite activity is helping the souls of the ponies who have recently died in Pony Driland. She has the ability to interact with souls, which other ponies cannot do that. She helps souls find acceptance of death to be safe and rest in peace. All the souls she collect are kept in a mysterious safe place, but it is unknown what secret place is.

### Personality (Incomplete)

Her personality is naturally malignant and dominant, but that doesn't make her a villain. She also has a good heart and is concerned with taking care of the creatures and her family who live in her dimension.
All her kind personality evolved with the help the mysterious pony she calls master.

Rainbow Queen has a personal affection for her pets. She likes to play with her pets' fantasy a lot to feel calmer through her evil personality, especially when she's in giant sphinx form.

Her personality is currently very unstable. She want to save Pony Driland and her life that depends exclusively on this dimension.

As she grew angrier, and her heart filled with hate and fear, it manifested in her powers, making her more and more somber. If an extremely large reality shock occurs along this path, she can literally lose control of her powers and end up destroying herself due to the large concentration of energy released by her feelings out of control due to her emotional instability.

Divine powers are naturally increased through determination, fury, hatred, or love.
When she feel sad, as her feelings become unstable, her powers also become unstable.
If something serious like depression occurs, this instability can be greater, causing other dangerous negative feelings that can increase the power wildly while leaving the creature totally unstable and terrifying. her physical appearance becomes sinister as the negative personality becomes sinister, resulting in a frightening and intimidating appearance.

### Power

She has high grade divine abilities. She was created to help keep order in Pony Driland. Her immense ability to manipulate the dimension allowed her to be almost completely indestructible. Her magic and the aura in her body and mane are covered in rainbows due to her nature of manipulative power that can control the dimension.

She can freely create and produce whatever she wants. But she doesn't use her power in its entirety for she has an ethical conduct to keep the dimension in order with less interference from her possible actions. Her powers are limited to the dimension energy. Her abilities are also used to manipulate the amount of energy stored in the dimension, making her a guardian of Pony Driland's existence.

Due to the fact that the Rainbow Queen has in its mix of races being a Sphinx Pony, she also has the ability to manipulate she size, being able to become giant or normal size at any time.

<hr/>

## Items

### Scythe

This weapon is the pure manifestation of her negative feelings. Divine creatures with negative feelings are extremely dangerous as their negative feelings can overload the amount of power evolved by anger, this scythe is invoked to try to drain the negative feelings and focus all the anger on a weapon where the negative energy can try to get controlled. But when this weapon is used, it can cause a great level of destruction due to the negative energies accumulated within it.
