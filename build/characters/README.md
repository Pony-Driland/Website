# Character Data Generator
Each JSON file in the "data" folder has the same name as the character folder stored in "docs/data/characters/". This script will generate files to create custom URLs for each specific character on the website.

One of the generated files will be stored inside the "docs/oEmbed/characters" folder. The JSON configuration called "image" refers to the image file format that will be used to display inside the character's oEmbed.
