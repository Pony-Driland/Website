Rainbow Queen is a unique blend of alicorn, sphinx, and kirin, with a white body and a vibrant, flowing rainbow mane and tail that stand out against the dark background. She has a fierce, intense expression, with eyes that appear white at first glance but are actually a mesmerizing blend of many colors. Black markings around her eyes resemble a mask, enhancing her striking appearance. Her horn features black accents, adding to her mystical and intimidating aura. 

She has large white wings and wears a glowing blue necklace with a central gem. On her foreleg, she has a golden bracelet adorned with two additional smaller gems. On her ear, she wears a golden accessory that adds an elegant touch. In her possession is a magical scythe that glows with multiple colors, though with a lower intensity compared to the vibrant glow of her body.

Due to the mixture of sphinx essence, Rainbow Queen also has paws like a cat.
