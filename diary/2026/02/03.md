who is in the mystery if the part of the chapter in time machine was abandoned, nope, I did not abandon, I just needed more time to develop the script that will help me create this part of the story.
This was really a bit frustrating, I had to study how this kind of narrative development works in Dragon Ball Z, in the movie Back to the Future, and the movies of the The Terminator.

But the good news is that I've already matured my understanding of time travels in science fiction and I'm already writing the first version of the script of how it's going to work.
but don't expect this to be something generic. the universe of Pony Driland does not work identically to the universes of other fictions, I am preparing something different based on how this tech works in this dimension.
I don't know if this has already become public information, but James (inside the story) has already explained a little how time travel works in Pony Driland.
