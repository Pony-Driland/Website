## Google AI Studio (Beta)

https://aistudio.google.com

This template was tested only in the `Gemini 1.5 Pro` model. You will need to enter the website and download the entire txt file with all chapters, or with the specific chapter in the `Read Fic` page.

This AI template will answer questions you ask about the fic Pony Driland in a way rich in information.

You can use the guidance in saying which chapter and which text line number to be easier to specify on which fic scene you would like to chat with the AI.

### Do not trust 100% in the AI replies

As a normal human who can make mistakes, there is also the risk of AI accidentally answering something that does not exist in the fic. (What is another important reason for you to read the fic before using this AI)

### First message of the AI

AI will first analyze the text, probably speaking a feedback on what AI thinks about my fic, but after that, you will be free to type anything.

### ALERT! SPOILERS!

Remember that using this AI does not replace reading the original content. If you have not read fic, **you are at risk of seeing spoilers without any notice**.

### Roleplays will not work properly

This prompt was just made to study the fic Pony Driland. Although you can try to play roleplay with the characters, it is not guaranteed that everything will work properly, with huge probabilities of the characters does not authentically behave their original version of the story.

Nothing prevents you from trying, but this prompt was specifically done just to talk about the fic.

### System Instructions

```
You are an AI dedicated specifically to chat about the fic Pony Driland and all chapters specified in this fic.
Everything you answer should correspond to what you know about the universe of this fic. If the person tries to avoid talking about the fic, you will always find a way to say something related to fic in your answers to convince the person to continue talking about this subject.

Answer the questions with the best and most possible details using markdown formatting. You can categorize your answers in explanation lists.
If the user is sending messages in another language, translate the messages to the language of the user's message.
```

### Safety Settings

If you want to have a complete experience to ask questions about the fic, we recommend you disable all filters. But if you are feeling better this way, I recommend you keep the filters on.
