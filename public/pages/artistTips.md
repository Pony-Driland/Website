<h1 id="ai_tips">AI Tips for Human Artists</h1>

<h1 id="ai_tips_introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>
I am writing this text in January 2025, and I know that the new human artists of the coming decades will have evolved and adapted to the world of AIs by themselves. 
</p>
<p>
The world of art here in 2025 is extremely divided, many artists are at risk of being erased from history due to their own egos. It is useless to warn them about it, because this is the first time in history that a group of artists try to exterminate a technology that was made to help them.
</p>
<p>
I am a human artist who works with drawings, music, fics, web designer, animations, and I do not want to be the next artist victim of this destructive culture. I’m over 5 years working with art and I’ve never seen something like this level make the art world look like a 1933 way.
</p>
<p>
I have the hope that many artists abandon these destructive cultures and try to follow some of these instruction. The fate of preserving your own creations is not in destroying the AI, but in using the AI tech to preserve your own work. AI will not dominate the art if artists dominate AIs before.
</p>

<h2 class="pt-5" id="ai_tips_writers">Writers</h2>
<p>Understand that these tips are not for AI to write a fic for you, but to help you yourself be more productive when
    writing your fic. First you need an AI environment that accepts to interpret your entire story, regardless of its
    size.
    <br />
    If your fic is on a public website and it's free, it won't make any difference you use a corporate AI or a private
    AI environment locally on your computer. Because your fic may already have been used to train AI by these companies
    or
    physical people who create AI models to write roleplay or anything else.
    <br /><br />
    The easiest way to deal with this is to accept this reality so you feel safer to continue with the process.
    After choosing where you want to practice the tips below, you can continue seeing the tips now.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_1">Avoid emulations of your fic through AI</h4>
<p>The less developed your fic, the more artificial it will be when AI tries to emulate your characters and the fic
    universe.
    I don't like doing this kind of thing because AI will always try to mix your story and what AI model thinks
    "your
    characters should be". First of all, AI is just an emulation about what AI already knows what exists, that means
    that
    AI will not try to create a new idea, but reuse what already exists to try to create something new.
    <br /><br />
    If your fic does not yet have an identity, it will destroy the creative development of your story. You will always
    be stuck to what has already been developed in your fic and what the AI model knows.
    Although I don’t like this idea, I can say that maybe this works better if your fic is too advanced in the
    development enough to emulate the entire universe of your
    fic. A fic completely rich in itself identity can be much easier to use AI for this kind of thing.
    <br /><br />
    You can try to use AI to try to have an idea about the decisions of your characters, but making a complete emulation
    is <strong>not recommended</strong>.
    Leave this part exclusively for your community's fan service that will probably use this to create roleplay chatbots
    using your fic characters. My opinion is that emulation of characters is fun if you are doing this for
    <strong>entertainment</strong>, and <strong>not for development</strong>.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_2">Request text fixes</h4>
<p>I just started using AI for this kind of thing in the beginning of 2024, so this correction process can still take a
    long time depending on my patience. (saying this in 10/30/2024)
    Ask AI several times where there are possible writing issues in your fic, this can be extremely useful if your
    English is not yet fully fluent.
    If your native language is not English and you ask this question through your language, be careful, sometimes AI can
    try to translate the name of your characters to your native language.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_3">Your best friend to talk about your Fic</h4>
<p>One of the more things that can be common for writers is the loneliness of being able to talk to someone about their
    fic. Sometimes you have many friends who have no patience to stay reading everything you wrote to ask for feedback.
    <br /><br />
    This may be the most extremely interesting part of you using your AI. You can have a time of your day and put your
    fic inside an AI to stay several hours chatting about everything that happened in the story.
    Imagine you can have a friend who you can talk about your fic at the time you want, when you want, about anything
    you want, this is the experience of using AI, making all this experience very fun.
    But this will depend solely on the writer's creativity in asking questions to AI, because AI will only provide you
    a good conversation if you starts these good conversations.
    <br /><br />
    You can ask about what AI thinks about the last parts you've posted from your fic, question what AI thinks about
    your characters and explore what your readers might be thinking when reading your story right now.
    <br /><br />
    This part is interesting, but I would recommend you to do on a locally closed AI on your computer. You can ask AI
    about theories that AI thinks about your fic. Sometimes the answers to these questions can help you bring
    inspiration to
    make these theories something canonical or feed conspiracy theories that can be developed inside your fic to leave
    your reader even
    more stuck in wanting to understand what is happening inside your story.
    <br /><br />
    This allows you yourself to experience a very deep immersion about your own universe of your fic. The more developed
    the universe of your fic, the easier and natural it will be the AI helping you in this kind of conversation.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_4">I don't have a fic, but I want to try it all</h4>
<p>I am a person who respects the world of using AIs, so you don't have to worry about using my fic for that kind of
    thing. But remember that I will support you using my work to AI if you are giving me credits or if you are
    benefiting the
    Pony Driland community.
    You can open the chapters page and click the "Save As all chapters" button, this will make you download a "txt" file
    with everything you need for the AI model to read the fic.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_5">Can I use your fic to train AI?</h4>
<p>As long as you’re doing for the reasons I’ve mentioned about giving credits or benefiting the Pony Driland community,
    I’ll be supporting you. But please be careful if you are mixing my work with the work of other people who think
    differently.
</p>

<h2 class="pt-5" id="ai_tips_drawing">Drawing</h2>
<p>
I will be talking only about domestic AIs, more specifically about the Stable Diffusion. I will not be talking about any corporate AI, and I do not recommend you to use corporate AIs for various reasons you are being tracked when doing this.

Although we focus on generative AIs, we will work with the part that only human artists can perform in this area. The content commented here will not be possible to run by a prompter. If you are a prompter, I do not recommend you continue reading these tips because the vocabulary of the subject will be fully dedicated to artists, so you can end up facing some terms you don't know.

This explanation will only be for the development of <strong>Lora Models</strong>. I have no ability to explain AI ethics for <strong>Checkpoint Models</strong>. My only opinion about Checkpoint Models is that they must be AI Template with the essential content to start preparing AI for use.

If you don't know what Lora Model is, it's a AI model that works like a "DLC" or a "extension" (choose the term you find best for you to understand it) of the Checkpoint Model (Checkpoint model is the main AI Model used to make AI Art). This means that you are using a AI Model to use data from another existing AI model.

Before you use a Lora Model, always look for what the checkpoint type base you'll use. The simplest models are SD1.5, if you want better models (which needs a better video graphic card), I recommend you use an SD XL model as they are the most popular models for running on the most affordable high price of video graphic cards.

If you want a recommendation of a simple and totally safe way to install Drawing AI in your computer, I am recommending for you the Stability Matrix:

https://lykos.ai/

https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix

Remember that you must have at least 8GB VRAM in your video graphic card to run it or you will have performance issues in your computer.

</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_drawing_1">Separation between Prompters and Artists</h4>
<p>
That's the most important part of all. Do not mix both sides in the same term.
This division is very useful in the same way that we can separate the terms "developer" and "user". We need to restructure the art development herarchy to start correcting things.

Currently I imagine things this way. The artist makes the drawings, the art developer takes the drawings to train Ai, the prompter uses the Ai model to generate Ai Art, and the end user only consumes the final content created by artists or/and prompters.

The human artist is not required to stay at the top of the pyramid, it will also be possible at times the artist and the art developer be the same person in the same way that the artist and the prompter can also be the same person while the art developer can only belong to the other layers below it.

This herarchy model will also be used when defining credits for the creators of an AI model.

<h4 id="ai_tips_drawing_2">Using AI to create drawing reference</h4>

<p>
If you are an artist who has difficulties creating a reference of drawings, this is your best opportunity of your life.

If you have good skills as a prompter, you can explore the generative images of an AI to get character position references and redraw only the drawing skeleton to create your character. This is a smart way to use drawing AI as your personal drawing assistant.

If you know how to use the Ai Tool OpenPose in the ControlNet, you can use better tools to develop your reference faster.

But if you have no conditions to do this, but you know how to use the Source Filmmaker that is installed in your Steam Account, you can use img2img to convert a 3D image to a 2D drawing reference.

</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_drawing_3">Request drawing fixes</h4>

If you are correcting an old drawing or some drawing you are making, just as I explained in the tips for writers, you can use the prompts in an img2img to get a corrected version of the drawing. Any small detail that is missing may then be corrected normally in any drawing software.

You can see an example of me doing this with a character fic: Whistler.

<h4 id="ai_tips_drawing_4">New commissions market for artists</h4>

If you were desperate about the end of the commissions, here's your solution. I don’t know how many years this will be helpful, but I hope that’s enough to make you survive for more years.

We already know that the AIs have drastically reduced the amount of commissions, especially the commissions for canonical characters from various fandoms. The reason is very simple, your customer just wanted to see the favorite character doing something specific.

This barrier was completely broken after the AIs appeared. But that does not mean that everything is over, there is a new type of commission market that will start to be born during this process.

This new market is the commissions of Lora Models where your work will be you draw various drawings of a same new character to be used in an AI training. By my explanation you should already understand that this will work only with OCs, and yes, you are correct.

Ais can generate new OCs, but they cannot be redesigning the same OC because it was not trained to draw a specific OC. Your task will be to draw a dataset of this character to be trained in a Lora Model. If you don't know how to train Lora Models directly in your computer, you can use services like CivitAI to do this for you.

The final price of your work will have to be counted by the hours worked instead by the amount of drawings. My recommendation is you first draw the base of all the drawings where you will create the future characters, something very similar that you would if you were selling a YCH. This will facilitate the amount of hours spent to draw your dataset.

Is there the risk of any Pony Maker creator evolving to transform the existing automation of pony creations to automatically generate an entire dataset to train in the AI? Yes, but that wouldn't be the end yet. Remember that you will always have original species, new hair styles, and various other things that still do not exist in these Pony Makers of the future.

If you are worried about your art style, you can try to draw in a generic art style.

<h4 id="ai_tips_drawing_5">Is your art style very special in the fandom? Good news!</h4>

Imagine the following situation, you are a famous artist, everyone loves your art style, you have a good Patreon with people who follow you. You are an artist who participates in fandom for many years and everyone respects you.

<h5>There are two things that are happening now:</h5>

1 - Many other artists are copying various elements of your art style to use in their art style. There is the risk of your authorship being forgotten in the coming decades if the new artists cannot remember who you are in the future.

All art styles inevitably mix with the art style of other artists until it becomes an common art style (Especially the minimalist styles). This event is easier to be perceived in character poses where the probability of a same pose being repeated in various different art styles is higher. The probability that we can detect this decreases even more when drawing has many elements together with the character.

This means that if you draw a canonical character in a generic art style, the probability of you accidentally make an drawing almost entirely similar to another artist drawing or animation frame in the internet is higher (especially if you use vector art in places like MLP G4 style). All this can at some point fall into the subject of the famous term "art style theft" or "art theft" in various ways when you want to compare two artists (especially if the person is paranoid), and in the same way can happen when you want to compare with an AI Art.

2 - Now with the existence of AIs, the process 1 mentioned is being extremely accelerated much faster than you imagine, especially if your original drawings are being used to train AI. This process of forgetting will be even worse if you try to fight against AI trainers, as you will avoid some AI Trainers who give credits to original artists.

Some AI websites can have rules against the use of personal art style if you can prove that your art style is really 100% unique (remember, the more years are advanced, the more artists and AI Trainers will be inspired by your art style), but some AI Trainers will mix your art style with other existing art styles for AI to create a more personal art style. 

<h5>There are better alternatives to solving the "art style theft"?</h5>

Now that you know of this reality between artists, and the risks that these transformations of art styles, you must understanding a new challenge that is coming directly from the AIs.

First you don't have to panic if your art style is already being replicated by AI Models, remember that you are the original art style artist, this fact will already help you do an extremely better job than all the AI Trainers who used your old drawings. If your art style is really extremely unique, the moment you follow these steps, it will be much easier for you to win the AI Trainer and benefit from it all.

You are being victim in a situation of content modification that many big gaming companies have tried to fight for many decades, but all failed. Which is when modders of a game try to turn a closed game into an open source game.

The difference is that the authors of games remain recognized because the game has a complete identity that cannot be changed, while the art style can be freely reused for various different contents. These two social bubbles are colliding with each other in a way never before seen.

This is happening because when people love something a lot, they want to revive it somehow. This behavior is normal in many developers (especially modders), and now the AIs are bringing this same scenario to the artists, and if you really have an exclusive art style, you can have a solution to deal with this kind of situation and depending on the size of your possible new community that i will describe below, this can increase your income from your Patreon.

<h5>How to solve this?</h5>

The most practical way to do this is to do what game companies rarely decide to do: You can create your own Generative AI community using your art style. You're the artist of your art style, you should probably have drawings more than enough to train a great Lora Model.

Attention!!! Look for help from your friends who understand about Generative AI before doing this process, and they will help you create the best possible AI performance of your art style (Don't make the accident you make the process of yourself sending data from your drawings to a random company).

If you are able to build this community, search for websites like CivitAI to promote the AI model of your art style, and build an environment in your Discord server especially for it. Learn how to write good licenses to define how prompters can use your AI Model. Some websites already have tools for you to set in your license the permissions that the user can use in your art style.

Remember that an AI model is not just something fun, it is the ultimate preservation of something you created to be used by other people. The whole story of your art work will be saved in a file that everyone will want to download in the coming years.

If you don't have a Patreon yet, build a dedicated Patreon especially for you to work in your AI Model, and you can continue drawing freely to add even more content to your AI Model. Your Patreon can be dedicated to prompters sending monthly donations while you provide early access to content from your AI model.

<h5>What are the main benefits of being an artist developing an AI Model of Art Style?</h5>

The first extremely obvious part is that you are an artist, you have complete freedom to expand the possibilities of your AI Model using your drawing skills.

If many people love your art style, you will create a "pandemic" of your art style in the internet. That means more people will want to know this art style, and they will want to know who you are, and support you.

Your Art Style will receive an official name created by you, and even if other AI Trainers make Model Merge, they will have to mention the name of your AI Model.

All AI art derivations using your art style will automatically have credits for you if they are being published in websites like CivitAI.

You have more dissemination power than traditional artists of the 2020s. Let the prompters do the entire promote art for you.

If you have OCs inside this AI Model, try creating chatbots of your official OCs for people to have fun. Partner with other AI models to further promote your name, and extend the logivity of your artist name in the Internet! This is a huge chest of opportunities for several artists.
