# Copyright

The song files of this folder are 100% created by me (JasminDreasond) using software such as Sonar and FL Studio and MIDI control equipment.

I'm storing song from abandoned projects and Pony Driland's official songs for future use in some expansion of the original project.

If you use some of these songs without permission, my only requirement is that you give credits in an explicit way that the song was made by me.
