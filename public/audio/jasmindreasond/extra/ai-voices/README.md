# Voice Clips – Modified by AI

This folder contains audio files originally recorded by me, **Yasmin Seidel**.

Each clip has been modified using AI voice models to match the voice of a specific character of my choice. The original voice in each file is mine, but the final result is altered to sound like the character listed in the folder name or description.

I put real effort into performing and dubbing these voice lines before they were processed by AI.  
If you use or share these clips, please credit me for the original voice work – it means a lot and supports the time and care I put into each recording.

These files are for personal, creative, or fan-related use only.  
Please do not redistribute them as official content or claim the character voices are real.

Enjoy!
