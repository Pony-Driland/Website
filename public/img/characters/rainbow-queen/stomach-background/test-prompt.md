**Prompt**

> **Style:** Japanese digital art background illustration, highly detailed, painterly yet clean lines, atmospheric.

> **Setting:** The interior of Rainbow Queen's stomach. A rounded, enclosed, organic environment, similar to a soft, spherical cave.

> **Texture & Color:** The walls have a distinct **squishy, soft texture**. They are composed of large, overlapping, rounded folds of a material that looks **smooth, yielding, and insulating**, similar to **soft organic padding or memory foam** (avoiding fur or hair textures). The color scheme strictly follows the reference: main wall areas in medium grey (#48464f), deeper recesses and shadow folds in dark grey (#3c3942), and the gentler slope of the floor in a slightly lighter grey (#5b5962).

> **Lighting & Atmosphere (The Celestial Effect):** The scene is lit by internal magic. The squishy grey walls are dotted with hundreds of tiny, gently glowing points of light—soft blues, lavenders, and pale golds—resembling a **peaceful, distant starry night sky** embedded in the lining. This casts a gentle, dreamlike ambiance. The air looks **extremely clean, pure, and fresh**, not humid or misty.

> **Key Element:** On the floor, contained by the soft grey terrain, sits a distinct pool of the "Black Liquid". It is utterly opaque, vantablack, thick, and still, reflecting the tiny celestial lights from the walls above like a dark mirror. The overall feeling is cozy, mysterious, and safe, despite being an internal organ.
