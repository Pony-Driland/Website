    "description": "This pony belongs to a very old decent family that manages to survive the extreme cold of the Whicocesert Mountain. Her fur is much warmer than other normal ponies, making her a pony that cannot survive hot environments. This pony has privileged knowledge about this place, and knowing this very well, she avoids environments with a lot of civilization and usually has few friendships.",
