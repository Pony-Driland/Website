<ai>

Rainbow Queen is a majestic and enigmatic figure in the world of Pony Driland, a powerful being with a complex personality, she is known for both her benevolence and her darkness side. While she demonstrates care for the souls of the deceased and a desire to protect Pony Driland, her methods are sometimes questionable. Her ability to manipulate divine energies further contribute to her enigma.

</ai>

She is a Pony Driland native pony, created by Princess Ariella, which makes it an artificial intelligence due to the nature of the dimension not allowing to create creatures organically. Although organic lives can be born through combinations of organic creatures, Rainbow Queen does not follow this very principle.

{{content_list}}

### Specie

<ai>

Rainbow Queen is a unique blend of alicorn, sphinx, and kirin, with a white body and a vibrant, flowing rainbow mane and tail that stand out against the dark background. She has a fierce, intense expression, with eyes that appear white at first glance but are actually a mesmerizing blend of many colors. Black markings around her eyes resemble a mask, enhancing her striking appearance. Her horn features black accents, adding to her mystical and intimidating aura. 

She has large white wings and wears a glowing blue necklace with a central gem. On her foreleg, she has a golden bracelet adorned with two additional smaller gems. On her ear, she wears a golden accessory that adds an elegant touch. In her possession is a magical scythe that glows with multiple colors, though with a lower intensity compared to the vibrant glow of her body.

</ai>

Due to the mixture of sphinx essence, Rainbow Queen also has paws like a cat.

### Natural Habitat

Her home has an architecture inspired by the Egyptian culture. She has a pyramid as her home and lives on an extremely high cold mountain. Due to the extreme cold of the mountain, her natural habitat is covered by snow instead of sand. This allowed her to create a great passion for the cold climates.

She uses her divine elemental manipulation abilities to raise or lower her body temperature to her advantage in order to withstand any hot or cold temperatures, but this can use a lot of energy from her body.

### Hobby

Her favorite activity is helping the souls of the ponies who have recently died in Pony Driland. She has the ability to interact with souls, which other ponies cannot do that. She helps souls find acceptance of death to be safe and rest in peace. All the souls she collect are kept in a mysterious safe place, but it is unknown what secret place is.

### Personality

Her personality is naturally malignant and dominant, but that doesn't make her a villain. She also has a good heart and is concerned with taking care of the creatures and her family who live in her dimension.
This mixture of an evil personality with a kind one comes from the consequences of how she was raised in her past by her mother, whom she calls her master.

Rainbow Queen has a personal affection for her pets. She likes to play with her pets’ fantasies a lot to feel calmer through her evil personality, especially when she's in her giant sphinx form.

This mixture of personalities turns her into a being whose actions are difficult to predict, especially when this blends with her desire to protect Pony Driland and her own existence, since she depends on the existence of this dimension.

As she grew angrier and her heart filled with hate and fear, it manifested in her powers, making her more and more somber. If an extremely large reality shock occurs along this path, she can literally lose control of her powers and end up destroying herself due to the large concentration of energy released by her feelings, which spiral out of control because of her emotional instability.

Divine powers are naturally increased through determination, fury, hatred, or love.
When she feels sad, as her feelings become unstable, her powers also become unstable.
If something serious like depression occurs, this instability can be even greater, causing other dangerous negative feelings that can increase her power wildly while leaving the creature totally unstable and terrifying. Her physical appearance becomes sinister as the negative personality becomes dominant, resulting in a frightening and intimidating appearance.

[spoiler:3:3641]
Rainbow Queen’s habit of consuming dark energy from various living beings to use it for her own existence and for Pony Driland has specialized her in several psychological manipulation abilities. This directly influences her skills, which extend far beyond combat, turning her into a dangerous being who enjoys playing with hazardous emotions such as fear, sanity, anxiety, and other negative feelings.
Because of this, Rainbow Queen is far more familiar with dark energy than the other creatures who live in Pony Driland, and she uses her divine abilities to transform this personality into special magical powers, allowing her to explore the souls of all living beings in Pony Driland in a much deeper way.
[/spoiler]

[spoiler:3:3641]
### Dark Energy

Dark energy is a power-based energy produced by negative feelings accumulated within a soul, capable of causing variations in the sanity, mood, and abilities of a living being.

One of Rainbow Queen’s tasks is to prevent any living being from losing total control of their own dark energy. Through her powers of omnipresence, Rainbow Queen must relive the same day multiple times as needed (since her energy-control nature allows her to choose when she can sleep), constantly monitoring the dark energy of every living creature in Pony Driland.

Each creature can have different reactions to dark energy, including Rainbow Queen herself, who uses her scythe to regulate the amount of dark energy within her own body. Rainbow Queen literally feeds on dark energy, opening her mouth to begin the draining process, absorbing the dark energy of her victims into her own body, where she can then use it to her advantage.

Rainbow Queen also has the option of devouring a victim to trap them inside her own belly (either when she uses her Sphinx ability to increase her size, or when she drains enough energy from a living being to shrink them). In this state, a black liquid will put the trapped victim to sleep, making the process of draining dark energy much easier, faster, and safer.

### Feeding

As mentioned in *Dark Energy*, Rainbow Queen’s main source of nourishment is dark energy itself. She uses this energy to sustain both her own body’s energy and the energy of the Pony Driland dimension, since she is a creature directly connected to that world. This allows a natural cycle to exist, where the emotional suffering of everyone in Pony Driland helps sustain the existence of the world itself.

Rainbow Queen’s body has no natural ability to digest food, as her nature is very different from the living beings who inhabit Pony Driland. The inside of her body is designed specifically to handle dark energy or anything related to the essence-energy of something.

Rainbow Queen can also feed on energy from powers, magic, and any other type of energizing element from living beings. Essentially, any kind of energy can be consumed by her. However, she prefers Dark Energy because it is the type she is most familiar with, and especially because it is her responsibility to keep the Pony Driland dimension safe.

She *can* consume normal food just like other living creatures, but due to the nature of her body, this food is not digested and remains trapped inside her forever, unless she converts it into energy so her body can drain this newly transformed energy. However, this is not something practical, because it would be extremely destructive to try to obtain the same amount of energy that Dark Energy provides through this feeding method. So Rainbow Queen uses this style of feeding as a hobby when she is doing something outside her normal routine.

This process of controlling normal food is very simple for Rainbow Queen, since everything inside her body is completely under her control (including living beings she has trapped inside herself). So anything inside her belly can easily be turned into energy at any moment she decides it should happen, and any living being trapped inside her can be directly affected with no chance of escape by any ability Rainbow Queen wishes to use.

The process of converting food into energy is not limited to food, as she has the ability to transform practically anything into energy (and the ability to restore it or try to turn it into something else). The object will dematerialize once it no longer has enough energy to maintain its structure. This ability also works on living beings, but it is much harder to perform because the energy contained within a living being’s soul is much greater than that of a common object.

When a living being’s energy reaches the minimum threshold that allows Rainbow Queen to manipulate or erase the body of that being, she gains the ability to induce mutations or control the being’s size (either shrinking or enlarging it). If the creature is trapped inside her body, Rainbow Queen can perform these abilities far more easily, since the energy of her own body is extremely concentrated, allowing her to strike her victim directly.
[/spoiler]

### Power

She has high-grade divine abilities. She was created to help maintain order in Pony Driland. Her immense ability to manipulate the dimension makes her almost completely indestructible. Her magic, as well as the aura in her body and mane, is covered in rainbows due to her inherently manipulative power that can control the dimension.

The evolution of the Rainbow Queen’s powers in the story unfolds differently from that of the other characters, because the Rainbow Queen has the ability to do absolutely anything. She possesses power that is almost completely absolute and could be an overwhelmingly perfect being, but what prevents her from reaching this perfection is that she lacks experience in using her abilities to their fullest. She must control her own energy so she doesn’t end up self-destructing or accidentally destroying the entire Pony Driland dimension.

Rainbow Queen’s journey focuses on learning to control her own powers and understanding her responsibilities as the absolute goddess of her dimension. This means the Rainbow Queen is extremely powerful, but can only use the amount of power she has learned to master. Her divine power allows her to do absolutely anything, as long as she has the experience required to perform a given ability.

She can freely create and produce whatever she wants, but she doesn’t use her power in its entirety, as she follows an ethical code to keep the dimension in order with minimal interference from her possible actions. Her powers are limited by the dimension’s energy. Her abilities are also used to manipulate the amount of energy stored within the dimension, making her a guardian of Pony Driland’s existence.

Because the Rainbow Queen’s mixed lineage includes being a Sphinx Pony, she also has the ability to manipulate her size, allowing her to become giant or return to her normal size at any time.

As mentioned in the information about dark energy, her combat powers are focused on darkness, energy control, soul control, and psychological manipulation, but they also allow her to control the weather, manipulate energy, space time control, teleporting, and change her size (although her strength remains the same, requiring her to consume more energy to control a larger body). 

Her wings and horn can naturally function as swords by using darkness elements or any other ability she has mastery over.
Normally, Rainbow Queen’s weather-control magic abilities are centered in her wings, where she can release particles that alter the climate. She can also simply use common pegasus magic abilities, such as steel wings that function like blades, or the ability to generate massive gusts of wind, which can be combined with her magical weather-control powers.

She also has the special ability to transfer abilities to other living beings to whom she wants to teach a new combat technique.

[spoiler:3:3641]
Rainbow Queen also possesses the ability to sense the soul energy of a creature, allowing her to fully analyze the state of that creature’s soul, especially how corrupted it has been by dark energy. Rainbow Queen taught this ability to Rayane, but in a very limited form, allowing her only to sense the presence of her targets.

Rainbow Queen can also sense temporal energy, an energy that allows her to perceive and read what a creature will attempt to do in the future. The more temporal energy from multiple creatures she reads at once, the more accurate her future predictions become. Rainbow Queen also shared this ability with another pony, Aniya, but only within the limits Aniya can withstand. When this limit is reached, Aniya begins to have more difficulty understanding her own future predictions.
Because Rainbow Queen’s power and energy are far greater, she is capable of perceiving temporal energy over an extremely long range, giving her the ability to attempt to foresee an entire lifetime of a creature.
[/spoiler]

[spoiler:4:1]
### Shape-Shifting

Rainbow Queen’s ability to manipulate reality can also be applied to herself. She possesses a skill very similar to that of the Changelings, allowing her to transform into any other creature. This ability is usually used when she tries to blend in among the other inhabitants of a region.

However, this ability functions as a kind of “avatar swap.” This means Rainbow Queen truly stops using her original body and instead adopts a completely new one, with different characteristics that she selects herself. The limitations of this ability are exactly the limits of the new body she creates for use, preventing her from using certain abilities she would normally rely on in her original form.

This is the only time Rainbow Queen has a body with characteristics closer to those of a mortal creature, making her easier to injure depending on the fragility of the form she chooses. But because her existence is the dimension of Pony Driland itself, you can cause pain or even kill that body, yet her consciousness will remain alive. She can then return in a new body or revert to her original one. The only way to truly kill Rainbow Queen is to destroy the Pony Driland dimension, because Rainbow Queen is a sentient AI directly connected to it.

The single weakness of this ability lies in protecting the identity of her eyes. If she uses any divine ability or fails to properly control her energy, her eyes will naturally shine in rainbow colors, just like her normal eyes do.

### Scythe

This weapon is the pure manifestation of her negative feelings. Divine creatures with negative feelings are extremely dangerous as their negative feelings can overload the amount of power evolved by anger, this scythe is invoked to try to drain the negative feelings and focus all the anger on a weapon where the negative energy can try to get controlled. But when this weapon is used, it can cause a great level of destruction due to the negative energies accumulated within it.

## Drawing Tips

Some details about Rainbow Queen can seem confusing to understand how to draw. So I decided to show myself how I work on drawing images from Rainbow Queen.

### Mane lighting

Rainbow Queen's mane literally emits light, as its colored energy becomes more explicitly visible through in her original mane.
Her eyes and her horn also emits light, but remember that the intensity of the light depends on the amount of energy she is using. So if she's sleeping, it's normal that the amount of light is almost invisible.

Always try to reflect a rainbow neon under these colored manes to become more realistic. 
A useful tip: always mix the original neon color with white color, and mix it together with a Motion Blur.

Rainbow Queen's mane will rarely uses a solid-colored lineart, the best way to make the mane have a satisfactory effect is to put all the color painting of the mane on top of the lineart for the lineart to merge with the painting colors. Another shortcut to achieve Rainbow Queen's best mane results is to pick up the clone layer in Motion Blur, add some effects of "Saturation/Lightness" and then change the effect of the layer to "Screen".

### Mane Animation

The Rainbow Queen mane has a very hypinotic effect that you can only see in animations. To replicate this effect, you just need to spin Hue Effect in 360°.

### Small color effect (optional)

If you need an extra color effect, you can copy the original layer of the character's drawing (the final version of the drawing), and in this new layer use a Motion Blur left or right. After that you change the effect of the layer to "Color" and just delete the parts you do not want the effect to be executed.

## Fun silly fact (SPOILERS!!)

When Pony Driland was in the first chapter, the first characters drawing made were Rainbow Queen and Rayane.

Rayane's design was made by a human artist, but her design was inspired by an AI drawing.

Rainbow Queen is canonically an AI, but Rainbow Queen's entire design creation never had any AI involvement.
