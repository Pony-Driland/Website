Epic dark fantasy score, 130 BPM feel, Massive orchestral palette: towering strings in aggressive tremolo and cutting staccato figures in harmonic minor, wide stereo image, Brass leads with searing fanfares and menacing low trombone stabs; percussion is dominated by thunderous taikos, rolling timpani, and explosive cymbal swells, A distorted, lush legato string countermelody snakes through the upper mids as a tragic, corrupted theme, interwoven with rapid, glassy harp arpeggios that shimmer uneasily, Energy arc: whispering tension → relentless march → cataclysmic climax → abrupt, hollow decay, Ideal for malevolent warlords, collapsing empires, and last-stand battles, harp, orchestral, deep, rapid, staccato
