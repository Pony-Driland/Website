## Image Reference

The development of the character's creation was in the year 2021. The character reference image came from the website `thisponydoesnotexist.net`.

I do not insert the exact dates that the image was sent to my computer. Then I will put an estimate according to the original file itself.

This design was originally not to be the design of a fiction character Pony Driland. I was trying to get inspired to make a new OC for a friend of mine who needed a character a little similar to Twilight Sparkle.
But he refused to use the character and wanted to continue using Twilight Sparkle in his own Discord profile.

But I had not given up on the character, I had a long work to choosing a great character creation reference and I did not want to discard all my work.

So I had contacted Synth Sparkle to modify the character's design reference, we decided that the new character would continue to be a princess, and create a new palette of colors until we reached the final result.
