# Crypto Config
Here you can configure the Smart Contract that will be used to store the data of the users who want to save the reading progress of the fic. You can also change the welcome message. Just avoid modifying the ABI.

To modify the ABI, it is important that you first modify the base.sol file.
As I always recommend. Use the Polygon blockchain as this is the best blockchain to work with this kind of functionality in a very low fee.

All these contracts were specially developed to work on the Polygon Blockchain.
