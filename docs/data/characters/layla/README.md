## This character's description may contain possible spoilers! (BETA)

Layla is one of Rainbow Queen's pets. Her sweet personality was a result of past events of her accidentally going to Pony Driland.

Like Amy... Her accident happened right during her childhood when she ran away from home, which made it impossible for her to grow like the other ponies, and she ended up spending the rest of her childhood struggling to survive on her own until she became an adult.

Her past is more mysterious than Amy about what she did in Pony Driland, but the origin of her fate is similar to Amy's.

As Amy, her fate ended up making her get lost in the woods, causing her to be chased by Rainbow Queen, she felt extremely sad and lonely for never finding her way back to her village.

Unlike Amy, she didn't try to commit suicide, she chose to attempt a slow and very depressing death from being lost in the forest in hopes of finding some pony to help her.

Rainbow Queen already knew she was feeling extremely sad, and tried to make Layla feel better together in the forest. Layla started feeling scared of Rainbow Queen due to Rainbow Queen's natural nature to be malignant, but as she spent more time together with Rainbow Queen getting to know her true Rainbow Queen personality. After a while Layla felt calmer, and everything that seemed to be a monster, she found that being friends with a possible monster could make her feel more secure.

Rainbow Queen despite having a dominant personality that is interested in being closer to her, Layla was very sad to have a second option, and agreed to be together with Rainbow Queen.

When Rainbow Queen realized that Layla was not wanting to be alone, Rainbow Queen being a goddess she offered a pact with Layla. Rainbow Queen invited her to be her pet, in return, she could have a much better life together with Rainbow Queen. She would have freedom of choice, but always respecting Rainbow Queen's wishes and should call her master.

Layla didn't think twice due to her sadness, and accepted her new fate. She was very scared of her choice.

Rainbow Queen then put the magic collar around her neck and made her new pet. Rainbow Queen then hugged her to calm her down and make her feel better. Layla then cried a lot again, but she slowly calmed down as she felt that even though Rainbow Queen was dominant, Rainbow Queen wanted to take care of her and not let her take her own life.

Since then many years have passed and Layla no longer knows her true age, as she always kept her youthful appearance, but many recognized her when they found her as a pony who likes to buy clothes and accessories of various types for her silly fantasy. that she loves.

Layla was no longer a depressed pony, feeling loved like the pet she is, she developed her new personality very sweet, happy, and cute. She came to be protected by Rainbow Queen through her magical collar. This made Layla develop a huge dependence on Rainbow Queen for her to feel safe while she maintained her shy personality.

She knew that through the magical collar, she could be teleported, or ask for Rainbow Queen's help. And then her new lifestyle that made her feel better continued, making her forget about her sad past, but still sometimes she was a little worried about what happened to her family, as now she was extremely far away from home.

## Items

### Collar

This is an indestructible magic collar created by Rainbow Queen. All pets that belong to her have this collar. In addition to a simple collar, it allows Rainbow Queen's pets to always have direct contact with her to request things like instant teleport to save the pets from any kind of danger.

All Rainbow Queens pets have the eternal life while the pet could be forever a Rainbow Queen pet. Ankh is represented in the collar symbol which is a mix of some Rainbow Queen symbols with the Ankh Symbol.

Due to the magic of the collar circling Amy's body, it makes her eyes no longer have the natural color, being replaced by colored ones.
