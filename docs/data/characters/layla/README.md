<span class="made-by-ai">

Layla is one of Rainbow Queen's pets, her gentle nature shaped by a past event that led her to Pony Driland by accident.

Much like Amy, her misfortune struck during childhood, when she ran away from home. Unlike other ponies, she never had the chance to grow up in a normal environment, spending the rest of her early years struggling to survive on her own until she finally reached adulthood.

What Layla experienced in Pony Driland remains more of a mystery compared to Amy, but the circumstances that determined her fate were strikingly similar.

Just like Amy, she ended up lost in the forest, drawing Rainbow Queen’s attention as she was hunted down. Unable to find her way back to her village, she was overwhelmed with loneliness and despair.

However, unlike Amy, Layla never attempted to take her own life. Instead, she resigned herself to a slow, sorrowful demise, wandering the woods in the desperate hope that someone would eventually find and help her.

Rainbow Queen, sensing the immense sorrow within Layla, attempted to comfort her in the forest. At first, Layla feared her, wary of Rainbow Queen’s naturally malevolent presence. But as time passed, she began to see the true nature behind the so-called monster. Slowly, her fear subsided, and she discovered that befriending such a being could, in an odd way, bring her a sense of security.

Though Rainbow Queen had a dominant personality and took an interest in keeping her close, Layla still struggled with the reality of her choices. In the end, with no better path ahead, she accepted Rainbow Queen’s presence in her life.

Realizing that Layla did not wish to be alone, Rainbow Queen, as a goddess, proposed a pact. She offered Layla the chance to become her pet, promising her a much better life in return. Layla would still have the freedom to choose, but she would have to respect Rainbow Queen’s wishes and refer to her as her master.

Without hesitation—driven by her deep sadness—Layla accepted. Fear still lingered in her heart as she embraced her new reality.

Sealing their bond, Rainbow Queen placed a magical collar around Layla’s neck, officially making her her pet. To soothe her, Rainbow Queen pulled her into an embrace. Layla, overwhelmed by emotion, burst into tears, but as time passed, she slowly calmed down. She realized that despite Rainbow Queen’s dominant nature, she truly wanted to care for her rather than let her fall into despair.

Years have passed since that day, and Layla has long lost track of her true age. Her youthful appearance remains unchanged, and those who recognize her often see her as the pony who enjoys buying a variety of clothes and accessories to fulfill her playful fantasies.

No longer trapped in depression, Layla found happiness in her role as a beloved pet. With Rainbow Queen’s protection, secured through her magical collar, she flourished into a sweet, cheerful, and adorable pony. However, this also led her to develop a deep dependency on Rainbow Queen, as she never felt truly safe without her.

She knew that through the magical collar, she could be teleported, or ask for Rainbow Queen's help. Then she continued the new lifestyle that made her feel better, making her forget about her sad past, but still sometimes she feel a little worried about what happened to her family, as now she is extremely far away from home.

### Collar

This is an indestructible magic collar created by Rainbow Queen. All pets that belong to her have this collar. In addition to a simple collar, it allows Rainbow Queen's pets to always have direct contact with her to request things like instant teleport to save the pets from any kind of danger.

All Rainbow Queens pets have the eternal life while the pet could be forever a Rainbow Queen pet. Ankh is represented in the collar symbol which is a mix of some Rainbow Queen symbols with the Ankh Symbol.

Due to the magic of the collar circling Amy's body, it makes her eyes no longer have the natural color, being replaced by colored ones.

## Image Reference

The development of the character's creation was in the year 2021. The character reference image came from the website `thisponydoesnotexist.net`.

I do not insert the exact dates that the image was sent to my computer. Then I will put an estimate according to the original file itself.

Unfortunately I no longer own the image generator seed of the drawing, because I renamed the file name.
