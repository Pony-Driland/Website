## This character's description may contain possible spoilers!

James is one of the scientists responsible for developing the source code that helped create the Pony Driland dimension. James' journey involves discovering what happened to the dimension, while sadly suffering from the loss of his original dimension.

This is one of the few characters who has a high level of knowledge about how the dimension really works, but he doesn't know everything in its entirety. James survived star wars, and it is unknown if his family survived the destruction of their solar system.

Due to his suffering past, James has a personality of someone angry with his own life, but at the same time someone who cares about others. He is usually anti-social and really likes to develop projects to help his team, even without realizing that this often hurts him due to his high workload that he applies to himself.

But none of that stops him from getting his hopes up that any possible survivors are still looking for him somewhere. James doesn't want to believe that everything he loves most has simply vanished from existence.
