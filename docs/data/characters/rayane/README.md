Rayane is one of Pony Driland's most mysterious ponies. There are many legends about her role and why she is always spying on other ponies.
What is known is that she is a talented swordsman and she has some spells that are considered extremely rare in Pony Driland like Teleport and regeneration magic.

Her favorite food is Marshmallow and she loves to change the meaning of words trying to confuse her victims or friends. Her love for Marshmallow makes her sometimes play a lot of silly games related to Marshmallow. Sometimes she does it innocently to provoke her victims. 

Many ponies are afraid of your presence. Some ponies have seen her doing mysterious missions and there are theories that she disappeared with some travelers from Pony Driland. Many want to know where she comes from and why she has advanced weapons and equipment. 

The story of her life is also a mystery. Sometimes it seems like she tries to hide some dark past.

## Image Reference

The development of the character's creation was in the year 2021. The character reference image came from the website `thisponydoesnotexist.net`.

I do not insert the exact dates that the image was sent to my computer. Then I will put an estimate according to the original file itself.

Rayane's design development was inspired by the Tempest of the movie `My Little Pony: The Movie 2017`. While the color palette was inspired by Princess Luna.

At the moment I'm writing this text I don't remember exactly what was the character that inspired me about Rayane enjoying marshmallow, but I know that this idea came when I saw many characters with unique wills to just a certain kind of food. The choice of the marshmallow itself was very connected to Rayane's personality, and it was funny that it appeared very suddenly during the progress of the story.
