## Character Information

### Specie

Female / Sphinx / Alicorn / Kirin

### Natural Habitat

Her home has an architecture inspired by the Egyptian culture. She has a pyramid as her home and lives on an extremely high cold mountain. Due to the extreme cold of the mountain, her natural habitat is covered by snow instead of sand. This allowed her to create a great passion for the cold climates.

She uses her divine elemental manipulation abilities to raise or lower her body temperature to her advantage in order to withstand any hot or cold temperatures, but this can use a lot of energy from her body.

### Hobby

Her favorite activity is helping the souls of the ponies who have recently died in Pony Driland. She has the ability to interact with souls, which other ponies cannot do that. She helps souls find acceptance of death to be safe and rest in peace. All the souls she collect are kept in a mysterious safe place, but it is unknown what secret place is.

### Personality (Incomplete)

Her personality is naturally malignant and dominant, but that doesn't make her a villain. She also has a good heart and is concerned with taking care of the creatures and her family who live in her dimension.
All her kind personality evolved with the help the mysterious pony she calls master.

Rainbow Queen has a personal affection for her pets. She likes to play with her pets' fantasy a lot to feel calmer through her evil personality, especially when she's in giant sphinx form.

Her personality is currently very unstable. She want to save Pony Driland and her life that depends exclusively on this dimension.

As she grew angrier, and her heart filled with hate and fear, it manifested in her powers, making her more and more somber. If an extremely large reality shock occurs along this path, she can literally lose control of her powers and end up destroying herself due to the large concentration of energy released by her feelings out of control due to her emotional instability.

Divine powers are naturally increased through determination, fury, hatred, or love.
When she feel sad, as her feelings become unstable, her powers also become unstable.
If something serious like depression occurs, this instability can be greater, causing other dangerous negative feelings that can increase the power wildly while leaving the creature totally unstable and terrifying. her physical appearance becomes sinister as the negative personality becomes sinister, resulting in a frightening and intimidating appearance.

### Power

She has high grade divine abilities. She was created to help keep order in Pony Driland. Her immense ability to manipulate the dimension allowed her to be almost completely indestructible. Her magic and the aura in her body and mane are covered in rainbows due to her nature of manipulative power that can control the dimension.

She can freely create and produce whatever she wants. But she doesn't use her power in its entirety for she has an ethical conduct to keep the dimension in order with less interference from her possible actions. Her powers are limited to the dimension energy. Her abilities are also used to manipulate the amount of energy stored in the dimension, making her a guardian of Pony Driland's existence.

Due to the fact that the Rainbow Queen has in its mix of races being a Sphinx Pony, she also has the ability to manipulate she size, being able to become giant or normal size at any time.

## Items

### Scythe

This weapon is the pure manifestation of her negative feelings. Divine creatures with negative feelings are extremely dangerous as their negative feelings can overload the amount of power evolved by anger, this scythe is invoked to try to drain the negative feelings and focus all the anger on a weapon where the negative energy can try to get controlled. But when this weapon is used, it can cause a great level of destruction due to the negative energies accumulated within it.

## Drawing Tips

### Mane lighting

Rainbow Queen's mane literally emits light, as its colored energy becomes more explicitly visible through in her original mane.
Her eyes and her horn also emits light, but remember that the intensity of the light depends on the amount of energy she is using. So if she's sleeping, it's normal that the amount of light is almost invisible.

Always try to reflect a rainbow neon under these colored manes to become more realistic. 
A useful tip: always mix the original neon color with white color, and mix it together with a Motion Blur.

Rainbow Queen's mane will rarely uses a solid-colored lineart, the best way to make the mane have a satisfactory effect is to put all the color painting of the mane on top of the lineart for the lineart to merge with the painting colors. Another shortcut to achieve Rainbow Queen's best mane results is to pick up the clone layer in Motion Blur, add some effects of "Saturation/Lightness" and then change the effect of the layer to "Screen".

### Mane Animation

The Rainbow Queen mane has a very hypinotic effect that you can only see in animations. To replicate this effect, you just need to spin Hue Effect in 360°.

### Small color effect (optional)

If you need an extra color effect, you can copy the original layer of the character's drawing (the final version of the drawing), and in this new layer use a Motion Blur left or right. After that you change the effect of the layer to "Color" and just delete the parts you do not want the effect to be executed.

## Fun silly fact (SPOILERS!!)

When Pony Driland was in the first chapter, the first characters drawing made were Rainbow Queen and Rayane.

Rayane's design was made by a human artist, but her design was inspired by an AI drawing.

Rainbow Queen is canonically an AI, but Rainbow Queen's entire design creation never had any AI involvement.
