## This character's description may contain possible spoilers!

Ariella was the first princess of her kingdom founded by her. she has a pure heart and loves all of her creation and her kingdom very much.

For her, the lives of everyone in her kingdom matters a lot. Her determination to make the kingdom a better place is extremely high. She could sacrifice herself if necessary just to save her kingdom life.

She is also a great mother and she always tries to teach her children all her ethics so that the future generations have the same level of responsibility as she were.

She uses her magic both to help her kingdom and to protect it. Your magic is also a giant reality manipulation skill and its wings can be used to produce fantastic magic in the sky such as manipulating the weather.

Her personality is kind. Her sense of justice to protect her kingdom can make her personality more dramatic and extremely defensive. Her worst fear is losing the things she love the most.

## Image Reference

The development of the character's creation was in the year 2021. The character reference image came from the website `thisponydoesnotexist.net`.

I do not insert the exact dates that the image was sent to my computer. Then I will put an estimate according to the original file itself.

This design was originally not to be the design of a fiction character Pony Driland. I was trying to get inspired to make a new OC for a friend of mine who needed a character a little similar to Twilight Sparkle.
But he refused to use the character and wanted to continue using Twilight Sparkle in his own Discord profile.

But I had not given up on the character, I had a long work to choosing a great character creation reference and I did not want to discard all my work.

So I had contacted Synth Sparkle to modify the character's design reference, we decided that the new character would continue to be a princess, and create a new palette of colors until we reached the final result.
