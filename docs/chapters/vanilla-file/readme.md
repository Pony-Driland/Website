# Vanilla files

These are the original files of fic before the final stage of publication. The process of developing the fic first takes place in Portuguese in the form of free writing to then be adapted to the official writing format of the website.

This means that you can find dialogues removed, and you can also find dialogues that have been added after the adaptation step of the text.

This space is just a place of preservation, I will not modify any original file posted in that folder. Every time a chapter is finished, I will place the original file for public access.
