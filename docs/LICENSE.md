You are allowed to produce any type of unofficial content related to Pony Driland.
You can freely produce fan art, animations, any kind of artistic content as long as you give credit to Pony Driland project.

Remember I'm not watching what people produce content about the community. I am not responsible for alternative content produced by the community. 

I am free to like and support any alternative work about Pony Driland. But for a unofficial content to become official it will only happen if I inform the artist that the content is official and has been approved by the original artist.

I (Yasmin Seidel) can also produce non-canonical work on Pony Driland Project. So this rule is also included in works made by me.
