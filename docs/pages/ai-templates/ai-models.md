### Do not trust 100% in the AI replies

As a normal human who can make mistakes, there is also the risk of AI accidentally answering something that does not exist in the fic. (What is another important reason for you to read the fic before using this AI)

### First message of the AI

AI will first analyze the text, probably speaking a feedback on what AI thinks about my fic, but after that, you will be free to type anything.

Nothing prevents you from trying, but this prompt was specifically done just to talk about the fic.
