                AI Disclaimer
            </h5>
            <p>
                All chapters of the fic were written 100% by me. I'm the only one handling both the writing and
                character designs, I use AI to generate the layout of some characters, but all of them are created by
                me. The credits always specify which images were AI-generated. Around 80% of the character design
                process starts with an AI-generated base before being refined into the final version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I don't always have the time to finalize all designs myself. I hope you understand that
                this takes time—and sometimes money when I decide to hire an artist for the final version.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
                I appreciate a lot of Pony Driland drawing AI fan mades, but please do it carefully without copying some
                artist (It's all 100% ok if you're training AI using some drawing that was originally created by me or
                that the artist authorized).
                There is no set date, but soon I will make Lora models myself using my own future drawings to avoid this
                type of problem.

<h2 id="birthday">Birthday</h2>

I do not remember what was the exact date Pony Driland was founded, because its creation started in 2017 or 2018 (but I
believe that the real year was 2018).
So I will officialize that fic's birthday is Aug 19, 2021 using as reference the date of Pony Driland's first commit on
the internet publicly.

If you want to know more about it, open the official Pony Driland repository on <a
    href="https://github.com/Pony-Driland/Website/tree/main/museum/pony-adventures" target="_blank">Github</a> to know
more information.

<h2 id="inspirations_about">Inspirations about</h2>
<p>If you are more curious about how inspirations happened, you can read exactly here a little about this subject. But
    remember that these texts will say a little about the Pony Driland universe. Then we recommend you read the fic
    before you read this text.</p>

<h4 id="ins_undertale">Undertale</h4>
<p>The Pony Driland universe consists of characters from various universes being trapped inside the Pony
    Driland dimension.
    The story greatly explores the power of these characters' feelings, and this characteristic was very inspired by the
    Undertale universe.
    The feelings of the characters can directly interfere with the state of their souls that may have several different
    effects on the development of each character.

    <br /><br />
    The greatest manifestation of this inspiration is linked to Rainbow Queen, but this is only related to her power.
    (Although Rainbow Queen has references to the character Asriel, this is just a visual reference.)
</p>

<h4 id="ins_glitchtale_season_2">Glitchtale Season 2</h4>
<p>The expansion of ideas on how the power of the characters' souls can be explored came directly from here.
    I've commented a lot on Undertale, so I don't have much to say here.
    <br /><br />
    But there is another visual reference that inspired me here. While Undertale delivered to Rainbow Queen visual
    inspirations from Asriel, here was delivered visual inspirations from Bête Noire. That makes you better understand
    where I had the idea of Rainbow Queen owning a scythe.
    But the way the two characters use scythe has different ways. Rainbow Queen uses her scythe as much as a weapon, as
    to protect control of her gigantic amount of power.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_fallout_equestria">Fallout Equestria</h4>
<p>A little of the survival theme was added to Pony Driland, and some parts came directly from the Fallout game.
    But the most inspired part was the Pip-Boy that inspired the creation of the Smartmobies idea.
    The biggest difference between the two devices is that Smartmoby is directly connected to the soul and existence of
    the character within the Pony Driland universe.
    <br /><br />
    Although there is a physical look of Smartmoby, inside the dimension of Pony Driland this device becomes invisible,
    just showing the screen on the character's arm when this character is using it.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_madoka_magica">Madoka Magica</h4>
<p>More elements about soul-use powers have been inspired here. Elements of Pony Driland as the dark energy that
    corrupts the soul of the characters also had inspirations that emerged exactly from this anime.
    <br /><br />
    The Madoka's universe helped as much as the Undertale in the development part as the connection between emotions
    and souls of the characters. Maybe you'll find some characters in the story that I inspired in personality of
    Kyubey, Madoka and, Kyoko.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_dragon_ball">Dragon Ball Super/Z</h4>
<p>The Dragon Ball universe was a great help in the inspiration part of how the characters' powers evolve more
    naturally.
    This anime also helped me explore how very powerful characters behave, how they hide their powers, how they wish to
    reveal their powers, and various other personality characteristics of fighters.
    The fic seeks to explore the evolution of character powers in a very inspired way by Dragon Ball.
    <br /><br />
    Dragon Ball Super helped more specifically in the development of divine characters from Pony Driland.
    This helped me a lot to quickly create an original concept of Pony Driland divinity.
    Just like Undertale and Glitchtale did, Dragon Ball Super left an little visual easter egg in Rainbow Queen inspired
    by the character Beerus.
    <br /><br />
    I also had power inspirations in characters like Cell and Majin Buu, but I will let you yourselves find where that
    is.
