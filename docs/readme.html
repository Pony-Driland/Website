                Pony Driland is a fanfic project involving science fiction, mystery, and drama, and some other topics
                that you can find out about through the website. This repository stores all files related to the
                canonical story of Pony Driland.
                The project development is being worked on in a private repository. This repository is used to share the
                final version of parts of the project and website.

                AI Disclaimer
            </h5>
            <p>
                All chapters of the fic were 100% human written.
                Due to the huge number of characters (and because I am a single person both writing,
                both taking care of the character designs), the designs of
                some characters were originally generated by AI and
                you will see in the credits what these images are.
                80% of characters design development first involves a pure AI version
                and then converts it to a final version.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I don't always have the free time to do this with all the characters.
                I hope you understand that I need free time to draw final versions. (and sometimes money when
                I give up and decide to pay an artist to make the final version.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of AI for Pony Driland content is permitted as long as you are making a model that does not
                steal other people's private art styles.
                The definition of private style is defined as a style of art that was made specifically for a specific
                project by an private artist. Always try to use public
                art styles that everyone already uses.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
                Please also avoid using drawings from other artists without permission. There is no set date,
                but soon I will make Lora models myself using my own future drawings to avoid this type of problem.
                I will make a dedicated page just for this. The base model has already been chosen and tested. I just
                need time to do the drawings for the Lora models.
                Other artists who are doing collaborative work (fan made) are also welcome.

<h2 id="birthday">Birthday</h2>

I do not remember what was the exact date Pony Driland was founded, because its creation started in 2017 or 2018 (but I believe that the real year was 2018).
So I will officialize that fic's birthday is Aug 19, 2021 using as reference the date of Pony Driland's first commit on the internet publicly.

If you want to know more about it, open the official Pony Driland repository on <a href="https://github.com/Pony-Driland/Website/tree/main/museum/pony-adventures" target="_blank">Github</a> to know more information.

<h2 id="inspirations_about">Inspirations about</h2>
<p>If you are more curious about how inspirations happened, you can read exactly here a little about this subject. But
    remember that these texts will say a little about the Pony Driland universe. Then we recommend you read the fic
    before you read this text.</p>

<h4 id="ins_undertale">Undertale</h4>
<p>The Pony Driland universe consists of characters from various universes being trapped inside the Pony
    Driland dimension.
    The story greatly explores the power of these characters' feelings, and this characteristic was very inspired by the
    Undertale universe.
    The feelings of the characters can directly interfere with the state of their souls that may have several different
    effects on the development of each character.

    <br /><br />
    The greatest manifestation of this inspiration is linked to Rainbow Queen, but this is only related to her power.
    (Although Rainbow Queen has references to the character Asriel, this is just a visual reference.)
</p>

<h4 id="ins_glitchtale_season_2">Glitchtale Season 2</h4>
<p>The expansion of ideas on how the power of the characters' souls can be explored came directly from here.
    I've commented a lot on Undertale, so I don't have much to say here.
    <br /><br />
    But there is another visual reference that inspired me here. While Undertale delivered to Rainbow Queen visual
    inspirations from Asriel, here was delivered visual inspirations from Bête Noire. That makes you better understand
    where I had the idea of Rainbow Queen owning a scythe.
    But the way the two characters use scythe has different ways. Rainbow Queen uses her scythe as much as a weapon, as
    to protect control of her gigantic amount of power.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_fallout_equestria">Fallout Equestria</h4>
<p>A little of the survival theme was added to Pony Driland, and some parts came directly from the Fallout game.
    But the most inspired part was the Pip-Boy that inspired the creation of the Smartmobies idea.
    The biggest difference between the two devices is that Smartmoby is directly connected to the soul and existence of
    the character within the Pony Driland universe.
    <br /><br />
    Although there is a physical look of Smartmoby, inside the dimension of Pony Driland this device becomes invisible,
    just showing the screen on the character's arm when this character is using it.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_madoka_magica">Madoka Magica</h4>
<p>More elements about soul-use powers have been inspired here. Elements of Pony Driland as the dark energy that
    corrupts the soul of the characters also had inspirations that emerged exactly from this anime.
    <br /><br />
    The Madoka's universe helped as much as the Undertale in the development part as the connection between emotions
    and souls of the characters. Maybe you'll find some characters in the story that I inspired in personality of
    Kyubey, Madoka and, Kyoko.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_dragon_ball">Dragon Ball Super/Z</h4>
<p>The Dragon Ball universe was a great help in the inspiration part of how the characters' powers evolve more
    naturally.
    This anime also helped me explore how very powerful characters behave, how they hide their powers, how they wish to
    reveal their powers, and various other personality characteristics of fighters.
    The fic seeks to explore the evolution of character powers in a very inspired way by Dragon Ball.
    <br /><br />
    Dragon Ball Super helped more specifically in the development of divine characters from Pony Driland.
    This helped me a lot to quickly create an original concept of Pony Driland divinity.
    Just like Undertale and Glitchtale did, Dragon Ball Super left an little visual easter egg in Rainbow Queen inspired
    by the character Beerus.
    <br /><br />
    I also had power inspirations in characters like Cell and Majin Buu, but I will let you yourselves find where that
    is.

<h2 id="ai_tips_writers">AI Tips for writers</h2>
<p>Understand that these tips are not for AI to write a fic for you, but to help you yourself be more productive when
    writing your fic. First you need an AI environment that accepts to interpret your entire story, regardless of its
    size.
    <br />
    If your fic is on a public website and it's free, it won't make any difference you use a corporate AI or a private
    AI environment locally on your computer. Because your fic may already have been used to train AI by these companies
    or
    physical people who create AI models to write roleplay or anything else.
    <br /><br />
    The easiest way to deal with this is to accept this reality so you feel safer to continue with the process.
    After choosing where you want to practice the tips below, you can continue seeing the tips now.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_1">Avoid emulations of your fic through AI</h4>
<p>The less developed your fic, the more artificial it will be when AI tries to emulate your characters and the fic
    universe.
    I don't like doing this kind of thing because AI will always try to mix your story and what AI model thinks
    "your
    characters should be". First of all, AI is just an emulation about what AI already knows what exists, that means
    that
    AI will not try to create a new idea, but reuse what already exists to try to create something new.
    <br /><br />
    If your fic does not yet have an identity, it will destroy the creative development of your story. You will always
    be stuck to what has already been developed in your fic and what the AI model knows.
    Although I don’t like this idea, I can say that maybe this works better if your fic is too advanced in the
    development enough to emulate the entire universe of your
    fic. A fic completely rich in itself identity can be much easier to use AI for this kind of thing.
    <br /><br />
    You can try to use AI to try to have an idea about the decisions of your characters, but making a complete emulation
    is <strong>not recommended</strong>.
    Leave this part exclusively for your community's fan service that will probably use this to create roleplay chatbots
    using your fic characters. My opinion is that emulation of characters is fun if you are doing this for
    <strong>entertainment</strong>, and <strong>not for development</strong>.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_2">Request text fixes</h4>
<p>I just started using AI for this kind of thing in the beginning of 2024, so this correction process can still take a
    long time depending on my patience. (saying this in 10/30/2024)
    Ask AI several times where there are possible writing issues in your fic, this can be extremely useful if your
    English is not yet fully fluent.
    If your native language is not English and you ask this question through your language, be careful, sometimes AI can
    try to translate the name of your characters to your native language.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_3">Your best friend to talk about your Fic</h4>
<p>One of the more things that can be common for writers is the loneliness of being able to talk to someone about their
    fic. Sometimes you have many friends who have no patience to stay reading everything you wrote to ask for feedback.
    <br /><br />
    This may be the most extremely interesting part of you using your AI. You can have a time of your day and put your
    fic inside an AI to stay several hours chatting about everything that happened in the story.
    Imagine you can have a friend who you can talk about your fic at the time you want, when you want, about anything
    you want, this is the experience of using AI, making all this experience very fun.
    But this will depend solely on the writer's creativity in asking questions for AI, because AI will only provide you
    a good conversation if you starts these good conversations.
    <br /><br />
    You can ask about what AI thinks about the last parts you've posted from your fic, question what AI thinks about
    your characters and explore what your readers might be thinking when reading your story right now.
    <br /><br />
    This part is interesting, but I would recommend you to do on a locally closed AI on your computer. You can ask AI
    about theories that AI thinks about your fic. Sometimes the answers to these questions can help you bring
    inspiration to
    make these theories something canonical or feed conspiracy theories that can be developed inside your fic to leave
    your reader even
    more stuck in wanting to understand what is happening inside your story.
    <br /><br />
    This allows you yourself to experience a very deep immersion about your own universe of your fic. The more developed
    the universe of your fic, the easier and natural it will be the AI helping you in this kind of conversation.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_4">I don't have a fic, but I want to try it all</h4>
<p>I am a person who respects the world of using AIs, so you don't have to worry about using my fic for that kind of
    thing. But remember that I will support you using my work to AI if you are giving me credits or if you are
    benefiting the
    Pony Driland community.
    You can open the chapters page and click the "Save As all chapters" button, this will make you download a "txt" file
    with everything you need for the AI model to read the fic.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_5">Can I use your fic to train AI?</h4>
<p>As long as you’re doing for the reasons I’ve mentioned about giving credits or benefiting the Pony Driland community,
    I’ll be supporting you. But please be careful if you are mixing my work with the work of other people who think
    differently.
